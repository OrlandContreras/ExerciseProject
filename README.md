1. Create a new Java project and try modeling a domain youâ€™re comfortable with. It could be

   modeled online shopping, you might create classes to represent: Customer, Product, Order,

   might make sense for them too. There is no example code for this.

3. Create an array and initialize it with numbers, 1-10
